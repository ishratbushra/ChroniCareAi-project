# 🧠 Deep Learning Insights into Social Determinants of Chronic Disease and Longevity

**STEM Fellowship 2025 – National Inter-University Health Data and AI Inquiry Program**

## 📄 Description

This project investigates the complex interplay between social determinants of health (SDoH) and chronic disease-related mortality using deep learning and interpretable AI. We utilized a globally representative dataset (2000–2021) combining World Bank indicators, WHO Global Health Estimates, and income inequality data. By applying models such as XGBoost, LSTM, GRU, and Linear Regression, alongside SHAP analysis, we provide both accurate predictions and explainable insights across diseases like diabetes, Alzheimer’s, cardiovascular disease, asthma, and kidney disorders. Our findings advocate for tailored health policy interventions based on income and regional contexts.

## 📌 Challenge Overview
 This hands-on competition empowers undergraduate and graduate students to explore real-world migration issues using underutilized Statistics Canada datasets. Participants analyze disparities in access to essential services, like healthcare, education, and employment, across immigrants, temporary residents, and Canadian-born individuals. It is presented by **Toronto Metropolitan University** in collaboration with the **Innovation Zones**.
## 📊 Dataset Background
 Curated datasets were prepared under the leadership of **Dr. Feng Hou**, Principal Researcher at **Statistics Canada**, provides a solid foundation for exploring spatial inequality and data-driven storytelling.

## 🧠 Research Questions
We focused on the following key questions:

- Which areas have a higher-than-average density of recent immigrants (2016–2021)?
- How do different immigrant classes (economic, family, refugee, and other) vary in areas with high vs. low workplace accessibility?
- How does generational composition differ in areas with high vs. low access to primary/secondary education?
- In areas with high populations of women refugees, do they face greater barriers to workplace accessibility?
## 📂 Given Dataset
